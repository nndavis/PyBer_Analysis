# PyBer_Analysis
 
 This PyBer challenge required python and pandas to be used to create a summary dataframe of ride-sharing data by city type, as well as matplotlib to create a multiple-line graph that shows total weekly fares for each city type. This data and graph splits into three categories; urban, suburban, and rural. This will prove useful to PyBer because it creates a visual to compare where the most money is being brought in, as well as what time of the year there are spikes and dips. 

## Results
 The data frame created for this graph has a lot of useful data. To start, there is an amount of total rides and an amount of total drivers for each city type.
The amount of rural rides is 125, suburban is 625, and urban is 1625. With those numbers, suburban is 5 times larger than rural, and urban is 13 times larger than rural. With that alone we see that over half of the rides through PyBer are in urban cities. Looking at the total drivers, something to note is that there are more drivers in urban cities than there were rides, and there is almost double the rides per driver in rural areas.  Below is the data frame I had created. Another thing to point out is that the average fare per ride decreases from rural to suburban to urban. This is more than likely due to shorter trip distances though. Below is the data frame I created.

### The Graph

 The graph gives a good visual of weekly data from the start of the year to the end of april of total fares for rural, suburban, and urban cities.
As you can see the more dense the city the more PyBer is used. There is also some odd spikes starting in February continuing through March. Overall the data here is great to look at to see the distrubtion of the money being made and split.

## Summary
 With this data, I am able to find three disparities among the city types. To start, urban cities have too many drivers available for the number of rides requested. Secondly, rural drivers are nearly doubled by ride requests; this is more than likely a good thing for the drivers, but there may be points in time where a driver may not be available for a ride request resulting in poor customer service and profit loss. Lastly, the average fare per ride is higher than the average fare per driver in only the urban cities; as well as being being the lowest fair altogether. Urban drivers are too abundant, so it would prove useful to find some way to combat the competition in the urban cities to utilize these drivers PyBer has available.
